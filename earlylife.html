       <h2> Early_Life</h2>


      
       <h3 style="text-align: center;">Contributions to Computer Science </h3>

       <p>  Bill Gates is one of the significant figures within the technological boom in the early 2000s and late 90s. Most commonly known as the founder of tech giant Microsoft, Gates is someone who led the charge into bringing the computer world to a whole new level. </p>
       
       <p>Come sophmore year at the university, Gates and friend Paul Allen would start developing programs for the first microcomputers. These microcomputers would later turn into personal computers and then handheld electronic devices. A few years later both would drop out of Harvard and start Microsoft. Reason being they had started incorporating a popular programming language for large computers, BASIC onto these microcomputers. This would lay the groundwork for their own licensed operating systems which dominated the 1980s called MS-DOS.  </p>
      
       <p> They later would sell this operating system to the world’s biggest computer supplier at the time IBM (International Business Machines Corporation). IBM would release the first ever microcomputer with their OS making them permanently dependent on Bill Gates and his Microsoft. He would later go on to develop one the biggest OSs in the world, Windows. Which was very easily accessible compared to the text command controlled MS-DOS.</p>
       
       <p> Around the same time they would also develop one of the first PCs which Gates would use for research and development called the Altair 8800. This microcomputer  was coined “the spark that ignited the microcomputer revolution”.</p>
       
       <p>In the early 2000’s Bill Gates and Microsoft would release development tools such as Visual Studio and .NET framework making it a popular choice for developers of all levels within the technological world to this day to use.
        In conclusion, Bill Gates in collaboration with his company Microsoft but primarily himself, has created some of the first personal computer operating systems, designed high quality revolutionary computers and online tools for the computer science community to use for generations. His effect on technological advancement and more specifically computer science has changed the world as we know it today.</p>
